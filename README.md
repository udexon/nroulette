Online casinos are perhaps one of the booming businesses that will thrive during the crisis and beyond, while we have no idea how long the Coronavirus lockdowns are going to last.

In order to avoid law enforcement using the technically self confessed "online casinos" here as evidence against anyone involved in this project, we shall call this a fiction project, i.e. we are merely telling a story of an online casinos, whether anyone would believe it and make it happen is beyond our responsibilities.

Open source, the most fair online roulette game in the world, technically challenging.
