N Roulette


We really have no idea how long the Coronavirus lockdowns are going to last.

So perhaps online casinos are perhaps one of the booming businesses that will thrive during the crisis and beyond.

In order to avoid law enforcement using the technically self confessed "online casinos" here as evidence against anyone involved in this project, we shall call this a fiction project, i.e. we are merely telling a story of an online casinos, whether anyone would believe it and make it happen is beyond our responsibilities. 

Everything after this sentence is the body of the fiction. Your decision to believe in it and make it happen is nobody's responsibility:

A social network project nowadays require multiple motivations across different communities to sustain sufficient momentum to kick start and grow.

As such, this project -- N Roulette -- where N could stand for many things depending on the participants, ranging from network, nude, to naked etc ...

 

Naked Roulette

37 ladies each represents a number on the roulette.

A roulette lady may resell her position to someone else, or work in group for sales and control of the positions.

A lady may opt to perform specific tasks based on the stake placed on her number, e.g. strip all, masturbate, penetration sex etc.

A lady may choose to be bought out and cease participating by any other willing party or herself.

Use ID-less transactions, cryotocurrencies.

We may use this idea to implement Phos Cloudless platform.

Open source, the most fair online roulette game in the world, technically challenging.
