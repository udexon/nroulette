### N-Roulette

N-Roulette -- where N could stand for many things depending on the participants, ranging from network, nude, to naked etc ...

Online casinos are perhaps one of the booming businesses that will thrive during the crisis and beyond, while we have no idea how long the Coronavirus lockdowns are going to last.

In order to avoid law enforcement using the technically self confessed "online casinos" here as evidence against anyone involved in this project, we shall call this a fiction project, i.e. we are merely telling a story of an online casinos, whether anyone would believe it and make it happen is beyond our responsibilities.Â 

Everything after this sentence is the body of the fiction. Your decision to believe in it and make it happen is nobody's responsibility:

A social network project nowadays require multiple motivations across different communities to sustain sufficient momentum to kick start and grow.

- ID-less transactions

One of the motivations of this project is to promote the idea of ID-less transaction --- a breakthrough since the days of Unix user ID where even blockchain inventors did not attempt to break away.

Some of the most obvious benefits of ID-less transactions are:

- It will enable online micropayment tipping (OMT) outside China.

- Donors and recipients of online micropayment tipping (OMT) will not need to create new user accounts on any new system. This step is replaced by installing an mobile app or visiting a web page (without logging in) that complies with our open and free ID-less protocol based on asymmetric cryptography (public and prive keys).

Unfortunately the idea of ID-less transactions itself is not sufficiently attractive enough to kick start developers to volutarily or commercially develop it. Hence N-Roulette.


### Naked Roulette

37 ladies each represents a number on the roulette.

A roulette lady may resell her position to someone else, or work in group for sales and control of the positions.

A lady may opt to perform specific tasks based on the stake placed on her number, e.g. strip all, masturbate, penetration sex, lesbian group sex etc.

A lady may choose to be bought out and cease participating by any other willing party or herself.

So you got the idea ....


### The Fairest Roulette -- Doubling as the Biggest Proof of Stake Machine

Now if naked ladies are not enough to get nerds (another N word!!) excited, I believe these two will:

- The Fairest Roulette 
- Doubling as the Biggest Proof of Stake Machine

Some mathematicians are gamblers. Some programmers want to be mathematicians. So here is the ultimate prize, the holy grail of programming and mathematics -- the fairest roulette.

Our ID-less protocol will be the purest decentralized protocol amongst all: the sender uses the public key of the recipient to encrypt a message and the recipient decyrpt it using his (her) private key, thus proving his identity. This is the most basic, fundamental and primitive operation in asymetric cryptography.

Using the ID-less protocol, we may connect as many devices (mobile devices or desktop computers) as possible, thus minimizing the bias in computing the outcome of a roulette game.

Of course, this is still a hypothesis. But isn't hypothesis in itself most attractive?

Use ID-less transactions, cryotocurrencies.

We may use this idea to implement Phos Cloudless platform.

Open source, the most fair online roulette game in the world, technically challenging.
